# 👋 Hei, this is how I quit smoking!

## 📝 Project Description
 This repo hosts a hackathon project I built in 09-24 when I was jonesing hard to relapse and start smoking!

 It is a PWA built on manifest 3 in JS using the calendar.js library.

 Because it was a hackathon some things were jerry-rigged but all in all I'm happy with how it turned out.

### ✨ Key Features
- 🎯 Feature 1: Tracks your quit time/progress/cravings and cigarette consumption
- 🔄 Feature 2: Populates a calendar so you can see your smoking/craving/quitting trends
- 🛠️ Feature 3: Tracks and displays basic stats on your performance to help keep you motivated to stay nicotine free.

### 🎯 Why Use this project?
- If you want to quit, although there are applications which are much better out there =) 
- If you want to pull it apart and see how calendar.js works or manifest 3.
